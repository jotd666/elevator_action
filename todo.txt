- AGA: 16+16 dual playfield
- ECS: 16 colors, 



TODO/ISSUES:

- elevator engine sound plays when player EXITS elevator
- different colors per level, including brick wall at the bottom!
- elevator dynamic colors: in progress

elevator column scroll:
- scroll change or tile write: recompute floor/ceiling tiles positions
  for that column and update copper fully. Maybe optimize: do not reset
  to bg color if small scroll value change (but later)!

- when writing a elevator floor tile:
  * 3a: write full elevator cabin (clipped)
- when small scroll change:
  * check positions of 3a + 3e
    on 3a: draw 8 green + X pink (clipped)
    on 3e: draw 8 pink + 1 green (clipped)
   implemented, not selecting proper column!

- if doesn't cut it with chipset exact on ECS, use 25FPS!!
- command line options are wrong
- insert coin when game is playing: is_game_playing doesn't work
- level colors are wrong (but level 4 OK)
- priority error when exiting rooms for player/enemy (lower sprite part)
- priority error in car going to right: player head/car: mockup end!!
- no exhaust fumes in car???
- no "BONUS xxxx" message displayed: should just be cookie cut blit after the
  sprites have been drawn, copied from the tile bitplane, if "B" is on screen
  at the proper location on 0xC400-0xC7FF

SOUND:

- when does the "ping" sound play?

minor:

- NTSC: menu update is slow
- some cover-up BOB colors are wrong too
  - when lights are out
  - on levels 2+
- parasite graphics on top (sprites)
- no sound for falling enemy: is there one?
- "forgot documents" out-of-tune jump sound doesn"t play, should play
  then proceed to "return to door" loop

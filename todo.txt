- AGA: 16+16 dual playfield
- ECS: 16 colors, if doesn't cut it with chipset exact on ECS, use 25FPS!!



TODO/ISSUES:

- elevator engine sound plays when player EXITS elevator
- missing music at start
- player killed: stops music after killed playing: kills sfx too, sfx should play
  maybe delayed (easier than hardcoding music end: too many ways to end music)
- command line options are wrong
- insert coin when game is playing: is_game_playing doesn't work
- priority error when exiting rooms for player/enemy (only lower sprite part)
  better experienced with enemy going out when player is on the door when it opens
- set palette: erase "bonus" overlay once
- should be able to turn off music with a key
- double elevators doesn't seem to appear anywhere. Seem to depend on difficulty setting too!
  ex on floors 15->10 there are double elevators on "easy" but not on "easiest". Here there are
  NO double elevators anywhere (even in lower floors!)
- test hurry up music



minor:

- sync issues with elevator colors in cycle exact, put the routine somewhere else?
- NTSC: menu update is slow
- some cover-up BOB colors are wrong too
  - when lights are out
  - on levels 2+
- parasite graphics on top (sprites): still there?
- discontinuous elevator cables (control word mixup)
- "forgot documents" out-of-tune jump sound doesn"t play, should play
  then proceed to "return to door" loop
- hack: when opening door, instead of clearing background, use a special tile
  to have purple background instead of elevator back
- exhaust fumes in the end are only white (limitation of overlay implementation)
  not a big deal!
- when does the "ping" sound play?

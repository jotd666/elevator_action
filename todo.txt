- AGA: 16+16 dual playfield
- ECS: 16 colors, no DPF, background restore
  sprites for the 4 first elevators, then bobs, bobs
  have Y translation applied to make up for non shifting!



TODO/ISSUES:

- elevator engine sound plays when player EXITS elevator
- different colors per level, including brick wall at the bottom!
- elevator dynamic colors: in progress

elevator column scroll:
- scroll change or tile write: recompute floor/ceiling tiles positions
  for that column and update copper fully. Maybe optimize: do not reset
  to bg color if small scroll value change (but later)!

- when writing a elevator floor tile:
  * 3a: write full elevator cabin (clipped)
- when small scroll change:
  * check positions of 3a + 3e
    on 3a: draw 8 green + X pink (clipped)
    on 3e: draw 8 pink + 1 green (clipped)
   implemented, not selecting proper column!

- cycle exact crashes: remove exx calls (will optimize at worst!)
- if doesn't cut it with chipset exact, use 25FPS
- command line options are wrong
- insert coin when game is playing: is_game_playing doesn't work
- level colors are wrong (level 4 OK??)
- priority error when exiting rooms for player/enemy (lower sprite part)
- priority error in car going to right: player head/car: mockup end!!
- no exhaust fumes in car???
- game over: sprites not cleared, red/green remaining elevator sprites: detect gameover/set column and clear??

SOUND:

- intro SFX music module: tune length
- noisy sfx
- "forgot documents" sound doesn"t play
- when does the "ping" sound play?
- record "hurry up" music for no9
- record "game over" music for no9 (code: 0xCA)
- 0x39: stops "return to red door" loop
- return to red door loop doesn't play



minor:

- NTSC: menu update is slow
- some cover-up sprites colors are wrong too
  - when lights are out
  - on levels 2+
- parasite graphics on top (sprites): to test again
- no sound for falling enemy: is there one?

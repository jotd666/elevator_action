ECS dual playfield:

TODO/ISSUES:

- draw elevators: ok but gaps, and trash when reaching bottom floors
- red door 0x20->0x27 should be HW sprite (special case because there's also blue door)
- scenery refresh bugs: not all planes are refreshed, or sometimes completely trashed, but then restored
  depending on scrolling value???
  => floor 28 enemy appears at floor 29: trashed refresh
- bogus sprite at start when character arrives: log when there are HW sprites, should be the first to display
- ELEVATOR title screen lower half not working: mark start of sprite??
- floor 15: elevator step tile not transparent but black!
- elevator start sound should play and chain to elevator loop
- palette change when lights are shot
- check "bonus" overlay
- check red door open + character + car in the basement: must implement a fallback solution
  to blit the red door (disregarding sprite priority)

minor:

- AGA: discontinuous elevator cables (control word mixup)
- AGA: when opening door, instead of clearing background, use a special tile
  to have purple background instead of elevator back
- AGA: exhaust fumes in the end are only white (limitation of 
  monochrome overlay implementation, barely noticeable)
- sound: when does the "ping" sound play?
- sound: "forgot documents" out-of-tune jump sound doesn't play, should play
  then proceed to "return to door" loop

to debug a value in game, use the following:
	.ifndef	RELEASE
	move.w	#0xC740,d7
	jbsr	display_debug_value
	addq.w	#3,d7
	exg	d0,d2
	jbsr	display_debug_value
	exg	d0,d2
	move.w	d0,-(a7)
	addq.w	#3,d7
	move.b	bottom_floor_horizon_8003(a6),d0
	jbsr	display_debug_value
	addq.w	#3,d7
	move.b	bottom_floor_fine_horizon_8002(a6),d0
	jbsr	display_debug_value
	move.w	(a7)+,d0
	.endif

 
to control sounds from MAME debugger:

bpset 125d,,{PC=1263;g}  music
bpset 307d,,{PC=PC+3;g}  elevator
bpset 4d55,,{PC=PC+3;g}  bullet hits wall
bpset 4425,,{PC=PC+3;g}  walk
bpset 4418,,{PC=PC+3;g}  jump

bpset 3656,,{PC=4429;g}  all!!
bpset 3656,,{A=$3A;g}    force all sounds to $3A!!!


to play an isolated sound at start instead of intro sfx:

bpset 4d92,,{A=$3E;g}

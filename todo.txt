- AGA: 16+16 dual playfield
- ECS: 16 colors, if doesn't cut it with chipset exact on ECS, use 25FPS!!



TODO/ISSUES:

- elevator engine sound plays when player EXITS elevator
- different colors per level, including brick wall at the bottom!
- elevator dynamic colors: in progress

elevator column scroll:
- scroll change or tile write: recompute floor/ceiling tiles positions
  for that column and update copper fully. Maybe optimize: do not reset
  to bg color if small scroll value change (but later)!
debug: update_elevator_copper_column

- get rid of double buffering, racing the beam should work here (AGA) but alignment issue

- command line options are wrong
- insert coin when game is playing: is_game_playing doesn't work
- level colors are wrong (but level 4 OK)
- priority error when exiting rooms for player/enemy (only lower sprite part)
  better experienced with enemy going out when player is on the door when it opens
- priority error in car going to right: player head/car: mockup end!!
- no exhaust fumes in car (probably chars too)
- no "BONUS xxxx" message displayed: should just be cookie cut blit (using image itself as mask) after the
  sprites have been drawn, copied from the tile bitplane, if "B" is on screen
  at the proper location around C6C1

SOUND:

- when does the "ping" sound play?

minor:

- NTSC: menu update is slow
- some cover-up BOB colors are wrong too
  - when lights are out
  - on levels 2+
- parasite graphics on top (sprites)
- discontinuous elevator cables (control word mixup)
- "forgot documents" out-of-tune jump sound doesn"t play, should play
  then proceed to "return to door" loop
- hack: when opening door, instead of clearing background, use a special tile
  to have purple background instead of elevator back

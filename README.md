# elevator_action
remake of Elevator Action for Amiga

Requires a 2-button joystick, or the keyboard

Features:

- 60Hz/50 FPS for OCS,ECS and AGA amigas
- PAL/NTSC screens

Note:

For ECS version you'll need 1.5MB of total memory. I could not make
it run with 1MB only. AGA version runs on vanilla A1200.
OCS version can run on 1MB only ECS, you'll need only 512k fast memory, but no
music and reduced sfx.
